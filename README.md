# About me
My name is Michal Banaszyk. I have a master's degree in philosophy and a bachelor's degree in administration. My professional experience to date is in the field of marketing and finance. During my work I had the opportunity to observe and work on improving and creating software necessary from the perspective of my job. Since that moment I started to be interested in software testing, which became my passion. In the nearest future I would like to gain knowledge and experience to become a tester.
